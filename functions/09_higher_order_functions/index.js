/**
 * HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS (HOFs)
 */


// Higher order functions are functions that either satisfies 
// one of the following conditions
// 1. Accepts one or more function as arguments (known as callbacks).
// 2. Returns a function as their result

//Since the functions in js as treated as a first class citizens.
//meaning they can be assigned to the variable, passed as an argument, and returned.
//they can be easily used to create HOFs
